### ‚úÖ What's New

- Basic **Solo play mode** is available (1 player only)

### üêû Known Bugs
- Some objects that spawn behind walls are still fully rendered, causing visual overlap. This will be addressed in a future patch.
- UI may appear incorrectly scaled on any resolution other than **1920√ó1080**.
- Returning to the level selection menu after finishing a level causes **all levels to display the same star rating** as the most recently completed level.
